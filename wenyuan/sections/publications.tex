\section{Publications\\ \& Research}
{\hspace*{1.7em} My research focuses on providing high throughput and latency sensitive OS supports on multi-tenant edge clouds while maintaining both strong space and temporal isolation with limited resources.
The majority of research lies in isolation, control plane abstractions and scheduling on the edge cloud.
I am the primary researcher on the edge cloud variant of the \href{https://composite.seas.gwu.edu/}{Composite $\mu$-kernel} .}
